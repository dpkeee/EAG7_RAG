Some homes are priced in the low $300's, to others ranging upwards to more than $1+ million dollars.

The growth and development of the area has encouraged the building of commercial businesses which is less than ten minutes away.

Gold Canyon weather is terrific with plenty of sunshine, no snowfall (except on the peaks of the Superstition Mountain), and beautiful days and nights filled with mild and hot temperatures. The 2010 census counted a population of 10,064, according to Wikipedia. But this number swells to about double the number in winter as "snow-birds"/and winter visitors come to enjoy the area.
