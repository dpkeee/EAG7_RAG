**Kansas City** (commonly known as **KCK**) is the third-most populous city in the U.S. state of Kansas and the county seat of Wyandotte County.[1] It is an inner suburb of the older and more populous Kansas City, Missouri, after which it is named.[6][7][8] As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 156,607,[3][4] making it one of four principal cities in the Kansas City metropolitan area.[9] It is situated at Kaw Point, the junction of the Missouri and Kansas rivers. It is part of a consolidated city-county government known as the "Unified Government". It is the location of the University of Kansas Medical Center and Kansas City Kansas Community College.

## History

[edit]In October 1872, "old" Kansas City, Kansas, was incorporated. The first city election was held on October 22 of that year by order of Judge Hiram Stevens of the Tenth Judicial District and resulted in the election of Mayor James Boyle. The mayors of the city after its organization were James Boyle, C. A. Eidemiller, A. S. Orbison, Eli Teed, and Samuel McConnell. In June 1880, the Governor of Kansas, John St. John, proclaimed the city of Kansas City a city of the second class with Mayor McConnell present.

In March 1886, "new" Kansas City, Kansas, was formed through the consolidation of five municipalities: "old" Kansas City, Armstrong, Armourdale, Riverview, and Wyandotte. The oldest city of the group was Wyandotte, which was formed in 1857 by Wyandot Native Americans and Methodist missionaries.[10]: 370, 384, 388

In the 1890s, the city saw an explosive growth in population as a streetcar suburb of Kansas City, Missouri. This growth continued until the 1930s. It was one of the nation's 100 largest cities for many U.S. Census counts, from 1890 to 1960, including 1920, when it had a population of over 100,000 residents for the first time.[11]

As with adjacent Kansas City, Missouri, the percentage of the city's most populous ethnic group, non-Hispanic whites, has declined from 76.3% in 1970 to 40.2% in 2010.[12][13] In 1997, voters approved a proposition to unify the city and county governments, creating the Unified Government of Wyandotte County.[14]

## Geography

[edit]According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 128.38 square miles (332.50 km2), of which, 124.81 square miles (323.26 km2) is land and 3.57 square miles (9.25 km2) is water.[15]

### Climate

[edit]Kansas City lies in the Midwestern United States, as well as near the geographic center of the country, at the confluence of the longest river in the country, the Missouri River, and the Kansas River (also known as the Kaw River). The city lies in the humid continental climate (Köppen *Dfa*) zone, with four distinct seasons and moderate precipitation, and is part of USDA plant hardiness zone 6.[16] Being located in the center of North America, far removed from a significant body of water, there is significant potential for extremes of hot and cold swings in temperature throughout the year. Unless otherwise stated, normal figures below are based on data from 1981 to 2010 at Downtown Airport. The warmest month of the year is July, with a 24-hour average temperature of 81.0 °F (27.2 °C). The summer months are hot but can get very hot and moderately humid, with moist air riding up from the Gulf of Mexico. High temperatures surpass 100 °F (38 °C) on 5.6 days of the year and 90 °F (32 °C) on 47 days.[17][18] The coldest month of the year is January, with an average temperature of 31.0 °F (−0.6 °C). Winters are cold, with 22 days where the high is at or below the freezing mark and 2.5 nights with a low at or below 0 °F (−18 °C).[17] The official record maximum temperature is 113 °F (45 °C), set on August 14, 1936, at Downtown Airport, while the official record minimum temperature is −23 °F (−31 °C), set on December 22 and 23, 1989.[17] Normal seasonal snowfall is 13.4 inches (34 cm) at Downtown Airport and 18.8 in (48 cm) at Kansas City International Airport. The average window for freezing temperatures is October 31 to April 4, while for measurable (0.1 in or 0.25 cm) snowfall, it is November 27 to March 16 as measured at Kansas City International Airport. Precipitation, both in frequency and total accumulation, shows a marked uptick in late spring and summer.

Kansas City is situated on the edge of the "Tornado Alley", a broad region where cold air from the Rocky Mountains in Canada collides with warm air from the Gulf of Mexico, leading to the formation of powerful storms, especially during the spring. A few areas of the Kansas City Metropolitan Area have had some severe outbreaks of tornadoes at different points in the past, including the Ruskin Heights tornado in 1957,[19] the May 2003 tornado outbreak sequence, and the Tornado Outbreak Sequence of May 2019. The region can also fall victim to sporadic ice storms during the winter months, such as the 2002 ice storm during which hundreds of thousands lost power for days and (in some cases) weeks.[20] Kansas City and its outlying areas are also subject to flooding, including the Great Flood of 1951 and the Great Flood of 1993.

The 2020 United States census counted 156,607 people, 57,079 households, and 36,392 families in Kansas City.[32][33] The population density was 1,255.5 per square mile (484.7/km2). There were 63,446 housing units at an average density of 508.6 per square mile (196.4/km2).[33][34]

The U.S. Census accounts for race by two methodologies. "Race alone" and "Race alone less Hispanics" where Hispanics are delineated separately as if a separate race.

## Government

[edit]### City government

[edit]Kansas City, Kansas, has a consolidated city-county government in which the city and county have been merged into one jurisdiction. As such, it is simultaneously a city, which is a municipal corporation, and a county, which is an administrative division of a state. The Kansas Legislature passed enabling legislation in 1997, and voters approved the consolidation proposal the same year.

The Kansas City, Kansas Police Department was founded in 1898. By 1918, the department had begun taking photographs and fingerprints of all the people its officers had arrested.

The Kansas City, Kansas Fire Department was founded on December 25, 1883. The fire department is part of the Firefighter's Relief Association and the International Association of Fire Fighters. IAFF Local 64 is a charter member and was organized on February 28, 1918. The department has 18 fire stations in the city and covers an area of approximately 127 square miles. The department also has specialty teams, including heavy rescue, hazardous materials, foam team, water rescue, tactical medic, trench rescue, high angle/rope rescue, and technical urban search and rescue.

#### Golubski scandal

[edit]This section appears to be slanted towards recent events. (December 2024) |

Retired KCK police detective Roger Golubski had been accused of sexual assault, protecting organized crime, and obtaining convictions on falsified evidence and coerced perjury.

Lamonte McIntire was exonerated and released in October 2017 after 23 years in prison for a double murder.[51] His mother claimed Golubski tried to force her into a sexual relationship. When she refused, Golubski framed her son. Detectives working the case refused to collect basic evidence. Former KCK Police Chief Terry Ziegler and other supervisors knew about this.[52]

On September 15, 2022, Golubski was indicted by a federal grand jury in Topeka, Kansas,[53] and arrested on six counts of sexual assault under color of law.[54] Another three-count federal indictment was unsealed November 14, almost two months later: Golubski and three other men—Cecil Brooks, LeMark Roberson, and Richard Robinson—were charged with conspiring, decades ago, to keep young women as sex slaves.[55] At the time of this indictment, Brooks was in a federal prison in Fort Worth, Texas; the locations of the others were unavailable.[56]

Golubski did not face trial for the federal case regarding the alleged abuse and assault of women. He failed to show up to the beginning of his trial on December 2, 2024 and was found dead at his home, the result of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.[57]
