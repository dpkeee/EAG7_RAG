# Armourdale, Kansas

**Armourdale** community is a district in the lower part of the Kansas River valley in Kansas City, Kansas. It is a main district between the West Bottoms and the Rosedale, Kansas area. The Kansas River makes an oxbow curve around the entire district, which is home to Shawnee Park and Bill Clem Park.

## History

[edit]Armourdale was platted in 1880, and incorporated as a city in 1882. Its name came from the Armour meatpacking plant in the area.[1]: 389

In March 1886, "new" Kansas City, Kansas was formed through the consolidation of five municipalities: "old" Kansas City, Armstrong, Armourdale, Riverview, Wyandotte.[1]: 370, 384, 388 [2]

The district was devastated by the 1903 Kansas City flood, and again in the flood of 1951, with damage adding up to about 50 million dollars that year. The 1993 flood, however, did no damage as the new floodwalls held up, and protected Armourdale from waters.
