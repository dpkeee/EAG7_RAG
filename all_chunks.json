They were his father's children by his first wife, who died after the birth of her third child.[34][35] His brother Ajit played in Bombay's Kanga Cricket League.[36] Tendulkar spent his formative years in the Sahitya Sahawas Cooperative Housing Society in Bandra (East). As a young boy, Tendulkar was considered a bully, and he often picked fights with new children in his school.[37] As a child, Tendulkar was interested in both tennis and cricket.[38] He particularly idolised American player John McEnroe, and emulated his hero by growing his hair long at the age of 7 or 8 years.

At this time, Tendulkar also regularly wore tennis wristbands and headbands and carried a tennis racquet with him as a sign of his love for tennis.[39][40][41] To help curb his bullying tendencies, his elder brother Ajit introduced Tendulkar to cricket in 1984. Ajit introduced him to cricket coach Ramakant Achrekar at Shivaji Park in Dadar. At their first meeting, Tendulkar did not play well. Ajit told Achrekar that he was feeling self-conscious due to the coach observing him, and was not displaying his natural game. Ajit requested the coach to give him another chance at playing, but watch while hiding behind a tree. This time, Tendulkar, apparently unobserved, played much better and was accepted at Achrekar's academy.[42][ better source needed] Achrekar was impressed with Tendulkar's talent and advised him to shift his schooling to Sharadashram Vidyamandir School,[29] a school in Dadar that had produced many notable cricketers. He made his debut as a cricketer for Sharadashram in late 1984.[43] Prior to this, Tendulkar had attended the Indian Education Society's New English School in Bandra (East).[43] He was also coached under the guidance of Achrekar at Shivaji Park in the mornings and evenings.[44] Tendulkar would practice for hours; if he became exhausted, Achrekar would put a one-rupee coin on the top of the stumps, and the bowler who dismissed"

In 1984, at age 11, he debuted in the Kanga Cricket League while playing for the John Bright Cricket Club.[43][46] Beginning in 1988, he played for the Cricket Club of India.[46][47] In 1987, at the age of 14, he attended the MRF Pace Foundation in Madras (now Chennai) to train as a fast bowler, but the trainer, Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee, was unimpressed and suggested that Tendulkar focus on his batting instead.[48] On 20 January 1987, he was a substitute for Imran Khan's side in an exhibition match at Brabourne Stadium in Bombay.[49] A couple of months later, former Indian batsman Sunil Gavaskar gave Tendulkar a pair of his own lightweight pads and told him to not get disheartened for not receiving the Bombay Cricket Association's Best Junior Cricketer Award.

The innings is known as the \"Desert Storm\" because it was interrupted by a sand storm. In 2020, a poll from the ICC declared it Tendulkar's best ODI innings.[90] In early 1998, while playing in an Australian tour of India, Tendulkar scored three consecutive centuries. The focus of the tour was the clash between Tendulkar and spinner Shane Warne, both at the peak of their careers.[91] In the lead-up to the series, Tendulkar simulated scenarios in the nets with Laxman Sivaramakrishnan.[92] In their tour opener, Australia faced Mumbai at the Brabourne Stadium in a three-day first class match.[93] Tendulkar scored an unbeaten 204 runs as Shane Warne conceded 111 runs in 16 overs and Australia lost the match within three days.[94][95] He also had a role with the ball in the five-match ODI series in India following the Tests, including a five wicket haul in an ODI in Kochi.

These twin knocks were also known as the Desert Storm innings.[97] Following the series, Warne ruefully joked that he was having nightmares about his Indian nemesis.[98] Tendulkar's contribution in the ICC 1998 quarterfinal at Dhaka paved the way for India's entry into the semifinals, when he took four Australian wickets after scoring 141 runs in 128 balls.[99] ### 1999: Asian Test Championship, Test matches, and the World Cu p The inaugural Asian Test Championship took place in February and March 1999, involving India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.[100] Around 100,000 attended the first four days of the tournament, breaking a 63-year-old record for aggregate Test attendance record.[101] In the first match, between India and Pakistan at Eden Gardens, Tendulkar was dismissed from the match after colliding with Pakistan bowler Shoaib Akhtar.

Television cameras captured images that suggested Tendulkar may have been involved in cleaning the seam of the cricket ball.[119][120] The incident escalated to include sports journalists accusing Denness of racism,[121] and led to Denness being barred from entering the venue of the third Test match. The ICC revoked the status of the match as a Test as the teams rejected the appointed referee.[122] The charges against Tendulkar triggered a massive backlash from the Indian public.[123] On the final day of the Kolkata Test against Australia in 2001, Tendulkar took three wickets, including the key wickets of Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist, who were centurions in the previous Test. His three wickets haul helped India win the match.[124] In the five-match ODI series that followed, he took his 100th wicket in ODIs, claiming the wicket of then Australian captain Steve Waugh in the final match at the Fatorda Stadium in Goa.[125] In the 2002 series in the West Indies, Tendulkar started well, scoring 79 in the"

Chappell reportedly felt that Tendulkar would be more useful down the order, while Tendulkar felt that he would be better off opening the innings, the role he had played for most of his career.[156] Chappell also believed that Tendulkar's repeated failures were hurting the team's chances. In a rare show of emotion, Tendulkar hit out at the comments attributed to Chappell by pointing out that no coach had ever suggested his attitude towards cricket was incorrect. On 7 April 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India issued a notice to Tendulkar asking for an explanation for his comments made to the media.[157] Chappell subsequently resigned as coach but said that this affair had no bearing on his decision and that he and Tendulkar were on good terms.[156] At the World Cup in the West Indies, Tendulkar and the Indian cricket team led by Rahul Dravid had a"

However, his highest score in the Tests was 91; Tendulkar averaged 34.12 in the series as England won 4–0 as they deposed India as the No. 1 ranked Test side.[254][255] The injury Tendulkar sustained to his right foot in 2001 flared up and as a result he was ruled out of the ODI series that followed.[254] Tendulkar created another record on 8 November 2011 when he became the first cricketer to score 15,000 runs in Test cricket, during the opening Test match against the West Indies at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium in New Delhi.[256][257] For his performances in 2011, he was named in the World"

He says that Tendulkar's quest for his 100th hundred has proved to be a hurdle for the entire team and has hampered their performance on the Tour of Australia.[259] Former India World Cup winning captain and all-rounder Kapil Dev has also voiced his opinion that Tendulkar should have retired from ODI's after the World Cup.[260] Former Australian fast bowler, Geoff Lawson, has said that Tendulkar has the right to decide when to quit although he adds that Tendulkar should not delay it for too long.[261] The selection committee of BCCI expectedly included Tendulkar in the national Test squad for the upcoming series against New Zealand commencing in August 2012.[262] ### 100th international centur y On 16 March 2012, Tendulkar accomplished a remarkable feat by scoring his 100th international century in a match against Bangladesh in the Asia Cup, held at Mirpur.[263] This was a pioneering achievement, as he became the first cricketer to ever reach this landmark.[264] This century was not just a momentous occasion for Tendulkar, but it was also his first ODl century against Bangladesh.

Despite the widespread media attention and public fascination with this milestone, Tendulkar confessed that it was a challenging time for him, as the constant focus on his 100th hundred became a mentally onerous task.[265][266] Despite Tendulkar's illustrious century, India was unable to secure a triumph against Bangladesh, resulting in a defeat by a margin of 5 wickets.[267] ### Domestic retur n After being bowled out in three similar instances against New Zealand and hitting a slump in form, Tendulkar returned to the Ranji Trophy to get back some form ahead of the England Series at home,[ citation needed] in a match for Mumbai against Railways on 2 November 2012. This was his first Ranji Trophy match since 2009. He scored 137 off 136 balls, with 21 fours and 3 sixes, to take his team to 344 for 4 at stumps on day one. [268] However, because of a poor form in the first two Tests in the series against England, and India being humiliated in the second match of that series by 10 wickets on 26 November 2012,[269] some people have started to question his place in the Indian team.

He scored 108 in the quarter-final against Baroda before being bowled by Murtuja Vahora, where Tendulkar was involved in a 234-run partnership with opener Wasim Jaffer (150) for the 3rd wicket at Wankhede Stadium.[273] Mumbai eventually piled on 645/9 and won on 1st innings lead.[274] In the semi-final against Services at Palam A Ground, with Mumbai reeling at 23/3, Tendulkar scored 56 from 75 balls and had an 81-run 4th wicket partnership with Abhishek Nayar (70),[275] and Mumbai eventually won on 1st innings lead after the match went into the sixth day due to rain delays.[276] In the final against Saurashtra, he was run out for 22 following a misunderstanding with Wasim Jaffer.[277] Mumbai eventually won the Ranji Trophy 2012–13.[278] He also played in the Irani Trophy for Mumbai, where he scored 140* against Rest of India and helped Mumbai to score 409 in reply to Rest of India's 526.

He is also renowned for his picture-perfect straight drive, often completed with no follow-through. The straight drive is often said to be his favourite shot.[317] In 2008, Sunil Gavaskar, in an article he wrote in the AFP, remarked that \"it is hard to imagine any player in the history of the game who combines classical technique with raw aggression like the little champion does\".[318] Sir Donald Bradman, considered by many as the greatest batsman of all time, considered Tendulkar to have a batting style similar to his. In his biography, it is stated that, \"Bradman was most taken by Tendulkar's technique, compactness and shot production, and had asked his wife to have a look at Tendulkar, having felt that Tendulkar played like him. Bradman's wife, Jessie, agreed that they did appear similar\".[319][320] Former Australian cricket team coach John Buchanan voiced his opinion that Tendulkar had become susceptible to the short ball early in his innings because of a lack of footwork.[321] Buchanan also believes Tendulkar has a weakness while playing left-arm pace.[321] He has been"

Since then, Tendulkar's batting has tended to be less attacking. Explaining this change in his batting style, he has acknowledged that he is batting differently because, firstly, no batsman can bat the same way for the entire length of a long career, and, secondly, he is a senior member of the team now and thus has more responsibility. During the early part of his career, he was a more attacking batsman and frequently scored centuries at close to a run a ball. Ian Chappell, former Australian player, remarked in 2007 that, \"Tendulkar now, is nothing like the player he was when he was a young bloke\".[322] Tendulkar has incorporated several modern and unorthodox strokes into his repertoire, including the paddle sweep, the scoop over short fine leg and the slash to third man over the slips' heads, especially in his later years. He is often praised for his ability to adapt to the needs of his body and yet keep scoring consistently.[323] While Tendulkar was not a regular bowler, he could bowl medium pace, leg spin, and off spin.

But as the president marked 100 days in the White House, many of the plans he has rolled out since the start of his second term closely align with those in the pages of Project 2025's sprawling, 900-page policy blueprint, which lays out an overhaul of the executive branch. Overseen by the Heritage Foundation, Project 2025 was an initiative that was designed to provide a roadmap for the next Republican president, now Mr. Trump. On the campaign trail, the president called some of its proposals \"abysmal\" and said he knew nothing about it, though CBS News' analysis showed many of its proposals were similar to his own. The authors of some of the policy guide's chapters served in his first administration and have returned for the second. Russ Vought is leading the Office of Management and Budget, and John Ratcliffe is in place as CIA director, while Peter Navarro, who was a top trade adviser to Mr. Trump in his first administration, returned for a second stint in the White House. Some of Mr. Trump's actions taken in his first days in office reinstate measures he put in place during his first term that were revoked by President Biden. But in other instances,"

The administration has already cut the Education Department's staff and is making plans to move some of its functions to other agencies. Shuttering the Department of Education, however, would require an act of Congress. # Ending diversity, equity and inclusion practice s The president frequently rails against diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, practices, and he signed an executive order on the day he returned to the White House ending all DEI programs within the federal government. Mr. Trump claimed in his order that DEI policies can violate federal civil rights laws and shut out Americans \"who deserve a shot at the American dream\" because of their race or sex.

Mr. Trump's directive came after he suggested that he could \"get rid\" of FEMA and leave disaster response management to the states. \"That's what states are for, to take care of problems,\" he said in late January. Mr. Trump also signed an executive order in March that declares it is the policy of the U.S. that \"state and local governments and individuals play a more active and significant role in national resilience and preparedness,\" and says that his administration will \"enable state and local governments to better understand, plan for and ultimately address the needs of their citizens.\" The overhaul at FEMA has sparked concerns"

FEMA has already denied requests for federal aid in response to severe storms and tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in parts of West Virginia and storms in Washington. Project 2025's sweeping book of policy proposals calls for \"reforming FEMA emergency spending to shift the majority of preparedness and response costs to states and localities instead of the federal government.\" It also urges Congress to change the cost-sharing arrangement so the federal government covers 25% of the costs for small disasters and up to 75% for \"truly catastrophic disasters.\" Currently, for Public Assistance, which provides financial and direct assistance to state and local governments for disaster response and recovery work, FEMA covers a minimum of 75% of costs, and the president can increase the federal cost-share at his discretion, according to a 2023 report from the Congressional Research Service. The recommendation follows a warning from Project 2025's authors that FEMA is \"overtasked, overcompensates for the lack of state and local preparedness and response, and is regularly in deep debt.\" Project 2025's book also calls on Congress to end preparedness grants for states and localities. \"DHS should not be in the business of handing out federal tax dollars: These grants should be terminated,\" it states. # Targeting"

Those stations are licensed by the FCC to operate, but are limited to operating as noncommercial educational broadcast stations. These stations, or NCEs, are exempt from licensing fees and operate on a specific \"reserved\" frequency band. Federal law prohibits these noncommercial educational broadcast stations from airing commercial advertisements. In his letter, Carr wrote that he is \"concerned that NPR and PBS broadcasts could be violating federal law by airing commercials. In particular, it is possible that NPR and PBS member stations are broadcasting underwriting announcements that cross the line into prohibited commercial advertisements.\" Carr also said that he also does not see a reason for Congress to continue approving federal dollars for NPR and PBS \"given the changes in the media marketplace.\" PBS CEO Paula Kerger said the cuts \"would devastate PBS member stations and the essential role they play in communities, particularly smaller and rural stations.\" Carr authored the section of Project 2025's policy book that deals with the FCC,"

According to Project 2025, \"stripping public funding would, of course, mean that NPR, PBS, Pacifica Radio, and the other leftist broadcasters would be shorn of the presumption that they act in the public interest and receive the privileges that often accompany so acting.\" The outlets should therefore no longer be qualified as noncommercial educational broadcast stations, according to the book. # Freezing federal assistanc e One of Mr. Trump's first actions as president was to establish the White House's Department of Government Efficiency — DOGE — run by Elon Musk, to slash regulations and spending, and restructure federal agencies. On the heels of that move, the Office of Management and Budget, or OMB, issued a two-page memo in January that ordered a freeze on grant, loan or federal assistance programs covered by Mr. Trump's executive orders, which would allow his administration \"time to review agency programs and determine the best uses of the funding for those programs consistent with the law and the president's priorities.\" The memo sparked widespread confusion and prompted concerns about whether programs providing meals for the elderly, pre-school funding for low-income children, medical research and other priorities approved by Congress"

Federal courts have since ordered the administration to reinstate any money that was frozen subject to the memo. Vought, the head of OMB, authored the section of Project 2025's policy book covering the Executive Office of the President, which includes the agency he has been tapped to lead. In it, he likens the budget office to an air-traffic control system for the president \"with the ability and charge to ensure that all policy initiatives are flying in sync and with the authority to let planes take off and, at times, ground planes that are flying off course.\" The memo may have been aimed at sparking a legal challenge to the Impoundment Control Act, a 1974 law that limits the president's ability to unilaterally freeze certain funds appropriated by Congress, and in most cases requires the president instead to ask Congress to rescind spending legislation.

Called \"Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation,\" the order directs certain executive agencies to take steps to ensure medical institutions that receive federal grants \"end the chemical and surgical mutilation of children.\" It also instructs the secretary of defense to take regulatory action to exclude gender-affirming care for minors from insurance coverage provided by TRICARE, the Defense Department's health care program, and federal employee health benefit programs.

Project 2025's chapter on the Department of Health and Human Services calls for its Office of Civil Rights to \"remove all guidance issued under the Biden administration concerning sexual orientation and gender identity,\" including the March 2022 document. The book generally criticizes gender-affirming care as causing \"irreversible physical and mental harm to those who receive them\" and argues there is a lack of evidence surrounding it. Many families and doctors who care for transgender youth dispute that assessment, and a group of families filed a lawsuit claiming the order is discriminatory. Two different federal district courts have blocked the president's directive, and those injunctions are being appealed. # Revoking security clearance s Mr. Trump took executive action to start the process of revoking the security clearances of dozens of former intelligence officials who signed a letter in 2020 claiming emails found on a laptop owned by Hunter Biden bore the hallmarks of a Russian disinformation campaign.

The order states that in recent years, \"there have been numerous and well-documented cases of career federal employees resisting and undermining the policies and directives of their executive leadership.\" \"Principles of good administration, therefore, necessitate action to restore accountability to the career civil service, beginning with positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character,\" Mr. Trump's order reads.

Critics say the change would enable the administration to fire government employees for no cause and replace them with Trump loyalists. Project 2025 repeatedly calls for Mr. Trump's Schedule F proposal to be reinstated. # Reinstating service members who refused COVID-19 vaccine s The president directed the secretaries of Defense or Homeland Security to reinstate service members, both active-duty and reserve, who were discharged after refusing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.

President Biden repealed that ban, but Mr. Trump has issued an order that effectively bars transgender people from serving in the armed forces and withdraws his predecessor's order. Mr. Trump's executive order states that \"expressing a false 'gender identity' divergent from an individual's sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service.\" Identifying as transgender, it continues, \"conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life.\" \"It is the policy of the United States Government to establish high standards for troop readiness, lethality, cohesion, honesty, humility, uniformity, and integrity. This policy is inconsistent with the medical, surgical, and mental health constraints on individuals with gender dysphoria,\" the president's order states. \"This policy is also inconsistent with shifting pronoun usage or use of pronouns that inaccurately reflect an individual's sex.\" Project 2025 calls for a reversal of policies \"that allow transgender individuals to serve in the military.

The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to intervene in one of those cases and is seeking to begin enforcing the ban. There are more than 1.2 million active-duty members of the military, according to the Defense Department.

The TPS designation was created by Congress in 1990, and it allows the federal government to grant temporary immigration protections to migrants from countries facing war, environmental disasters or other crises that make it dangerous to send deportees there.

NIH said in its memo that it has spent billions on indirect costs for more than 2,500 universities, medical schools and other research institutions across the country, and noted that \"most private foundations that fund research provide substantially lower indirect costs than the federal government, and universities readily accept grants from these foundations.\" Project 2025 also focused on indirect costs and called on Congress to \"cap the indirect cost rate paid to universities so that it does not exceed the lowest rate a university accepts from a private organization to fund search efforts.\" \"This market-based reform would help reduce federal taxpayer subsidization of leftist agendas,\" the policy book read. While Project 2025 said it is up to Congress to cap the indirect cost rate, the Trump administration took this step unilaterally, prompting legal challenges from universities, states and organizations that represent medical colleges and schools. Universities and the NIH said the cuts will have a \"dire impact\" on lifesaving research, including clinical trials for cancer and Alzheimer's patients. # Requiring disclosures of foreign gifts to universitie s As part of a series of executive orders addressing the education system, Mr. Trump issued a directive on April 23 that directs the education secretary to enforce a provision of the Higher Education Act that requires higher education institutions that receive federal dollars to disclose any gifts of contracts from a foreign source valued at $250,000 or more in a calendar year. The move is also part of Project 2025, which calls on the next"

The move is also part of Project 2025, which calls on the next administration to enforce that statute, investigate higher education institutions that do not honor the obligations laid out in the law and make \"appropriate referrals\" to the Justice Department. # Asserting the president's power to remove federal official s Since returning to the White House, Mr. Trump has sought to fire the members of independent agencies and inspectors general, despite federal laws that lay out the grounds for their removals. The terminations have sparked multiple court fights that appear aimed at asserting what the Trump administration believes is the president's unrestricted power to remove executive branch officials. But a 90-year-old Supreme Court decision, Humphrey's Executor v. United States, found that Congress could impose for-cause removal protections to multi-member commissions of experts that are balanced along partisan lines and do not exercise any executive power. In a February letter to Congress, then-acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris said the Justice Department \"intends to urge the Supreme Court to overrule that decision, which prevents the president from adequately supervising principal officers in the executive branch who execute the laws on the president's behalf, and which has already been severely eroded by recent Supreme Court decisions.\" Project 2025, too, suggested the next Republican presidential administration should seek the reversal of Humphrey's Executor. \"The next conservative administration should formally take the position"

The proposal calls for OAR to be eliminated as an office, as well as funding for climate, weather and ocean laboratories, cooperative institutes and other programs. Current and former officials with NOAA have said the memo's objectives are \"devastating,\" and have argued that research is crucial to improving services such as severe weather forecasts for the public."
